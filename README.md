# Mouse Trailer

A dynamic and interactive mouse cursor effect built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The trailer smoothly follows the cursor and morphs when interacting with specific elements.

## Features

- **Smooth Movement**: The trailer follows the mouse cursor with a fluid animation.
- **Interactive States**: 
  - Scales up when hovering over "interactable" elements.
  - Displays contextual icons (e.g., an image icon) based on the element's `data-type`.
- **Dynamic Icons**: Uses FontAwesome for scalable vector icons inside the trailer.
- **Responsive Opacity**: The trailer fades in when the mouse enters the window and fades out when it leaves (or is inactive).
